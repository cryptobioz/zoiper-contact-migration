# Zoiper Contact Migration

*Simple tool to migrate your contacts from old Zoiper versions to Zoiper 5.*

## How to use

To migrate your contacts, just run this command:

```shell
./zoiper-migrate.py -f [OLD_CONTACT_FILE] -t [NEW_CONTACT_FILE]
```

On Ubuntu/Debian, the default old contact file is `~/.Zoiper/Contacts.xml` and the default new contact file is `~/.Zoiper5/ContactsV2.db`.
